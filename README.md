# About

Simple web app to pick a new house, and check which one is better by checking the distance between places.

# Runnig the project

Add your Google Maps API Key in `.env.local`. _(Check the `.env.example`)_

Run the project in a development environment with:
```
$ yarn dev
```

# Future ideas

- [ ] Use Google's Geocode to find coordinates easier
- [ ] Use Google's street to correct show path between houses and places
- [ ] Use Google's DistanceMatrix to correct calculate distance between houses and places _(currently calculating distance in simple straight line)_
